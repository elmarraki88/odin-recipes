    <h3>Lamb and Butternut Squash Tagine with Apricots</h3>
    <p>
        The natural juices from the lamb and onion create steam that bastes the meat as it cooks over a low flame.
        The gentle heat ensures that the environment inside the tagine remains moist and does not dry out or burn.
        Savory lamb, salty olives, and ras el hanout are balanced by sweet butternut squash, apricots, and a touch of honey.
